# Genius-Game-Project---PIC18F4520---Milford-4x20-BKP

This is the C code to the Genius Game project. 
The software was compiled using the XC8 compiler in the MPLAB X (v.5.50) platform. 
The hardware of this project was created and tested on the Proteus (v.8.13) platform. 
It was used a PIC microcontroller (PIC18F4520) and a Milford-4x20-BKP.

The connection between PIc and LCD needs a library to be compiled. You can find this library in microchip's website or in the link below:

Scroll down to Peripheral Libraries, in the PIC18F section, find your your OS platform, and download the library.

After you've download and installed the library, copy the folders "include" and "source" and paste it in your folder
